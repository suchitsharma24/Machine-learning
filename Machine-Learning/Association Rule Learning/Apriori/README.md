## Apriori Association Rule

Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in domains such as market basket analysis.

**Case study:** The Manager of a grocery store in the south of France wanted to optimize the sales of their products using Association Rule Learning to know exactly where to place the products in the store. Use the Apriori Association Learning Rule to solve the case study.
