## Random Forest Classifier Model

A random forest classifier.

A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is always the same as the original input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement if bootstrap=True (default).

**Case study:** An automobile company wants to predict through a campaign whether a person will purchase a new SUV launched at a very reasonable price based on that person's Age and Salary, based on the results, the company will target those who fall under the category of purchasing the SUV. The outcome would be '0' means the person will NOT purchase the SUV, and '1' if that person will purchase the SUV. Use Random Forest Classifier model and predict the best kernel model based on the outcome of the case study and visualize the result.
