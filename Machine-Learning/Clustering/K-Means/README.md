## K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering algorithm computes the centroids and iterates until we find the optimal centroid. It assumes that the number of clusters is already known. It is also called a flat clustering algorithm. The number of clusters identified from data by the algorithm is represented by ‘K’ in K-means.

In this algorithm, the data points are assigned to a cluster in such a manner that the sum of the squared distance between the data points and centroid would be minimum. It is to be understood that less variation within the clusters will lead to more similar data points within the same cluster.

**Case study:** The marketing team for some Mall wants to predict the type of their customers based on their salary (k$) and spending score (1-100) to target them for their upcoming product launch/sale events to get maximum profit. Use the K-Means clustering algorithm and find the optimum clusters using the elbow method.
