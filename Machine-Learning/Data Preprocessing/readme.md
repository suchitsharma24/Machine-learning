##  Data Preprocessing 

To build any  Machine Learning model, the very first task is to make any data ready before applying any machine learning model on it. Hence, in this model, we are going to see data preprocessing steps using a sklearn (short form of scikit-learn) library.

Data Preprocessing steps:

1. Import basic required libraries
2. Importing dataset
3. Handling of missing values (if any)
4. Encoding any categorical data/feature
5. Splitting the input data into a Training set and a Testing set
6. Feature Scaling (not applicable in few models)

We will see a demonstration with the help of a small demo dataset which is attached within the folder.
