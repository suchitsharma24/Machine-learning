## Grid Search

A machine learning model has two types of parameters. The first type of parameters are the parameters that are learned through a machine learning model while the second type of parameters are the hyper parameter that we pass to the machine learning model.

Normally we randomly set the value for these hyper parameters and see what parameters result in best performance. However randomly selecting the parameters for the algorithm can be exhaustive.

Also, it is not easy to compare performance of different algorithms by randomly setting the hyper parameters because one algorithm may perform better than the other with different set of parameters. And if the parameters are changed, the algorithm may perform worse than the other algorithms.

Therefore, instead of randomly selecting the values of the parameters, a better approach would be to develop an algorithm which automatically finds the best parameters for a particular model. Grid Search is one such algorithm.

**Case study:** To analyze Social Network dataset and to predict whether the user will click on the ad and buy the SUV. Use Kernel Principal Component Analysis model to solve this case study and use Grid Search algorithm to predict the best parameter for the model and finally calculate the accuracy of the model.
