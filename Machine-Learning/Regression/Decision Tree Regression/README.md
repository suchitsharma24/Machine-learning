## Decision Tree Regression Model

Decision tree learning is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining and machine learning. It uses a decision tree (as a predictive model) to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.

In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data (but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making). This page deals with decision trees in data mining.

**Case study:** To predict the salary of an ex-employee who claims to be on the Region Manager Level with $160000 Salary. Predict if the employee is honest or not. Use Decision Tree Regression algorithm and predict the Salary of an ex-employee and check whether an employee is lying or not.
