**Case study:** To predict the profit of a company based on various spends like R&D, Administration, Marketing, and the State in which the company operates. Build a model to check if there are some linear dependencies between all these variables. Use the Multiple Regression model, plus, handle any missing data as well as a categorical variable (if any).
