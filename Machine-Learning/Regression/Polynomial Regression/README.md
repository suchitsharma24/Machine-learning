## Polynomial Linear Regression Model

In statistics, polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial in x. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x). Although polynomial regression fits a nonlinear model to the data, as a statistical estimation problem it is linear, in the sense that the regression function E(y | x) is linear in the unknown parameters that are estimated from the data. For this reason, polynomial regression is considered to be a special case of multiple linear regression.

**Case study:** To predict the salary of an ex-employee who claims to be on the Region Manager Level with $160000 Salary. Predict if the employee is honest or not. Use Polynomial regression up to degree=4 and predict the Salary of an ex-employee and check whether an employee is lying or not.
