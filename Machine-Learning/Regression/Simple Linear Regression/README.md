## Simple Linear Regression Model

In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable. That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables. The adjective simple refers to the fact that the outcome variable is related to a single predictor.

**Case study:** To predict the Salary of an employee of abc company based on the number of experience of an employee using simple linear regression in python. Here, the independent variable would be 'YearsExperience' and dependent variable would be 'Salary'. Also, plot the predicted value using regression line on the plot using matplotlib library.
